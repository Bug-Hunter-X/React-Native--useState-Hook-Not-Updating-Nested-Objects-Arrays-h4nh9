This error occurs when using the `useState` hook in React Native, particularly when dealing with objects or arrays.  The issue is that React's shallow comparison mechanism for state updates doesn't detect changes within nested objects or arrays.  If you modify a property within a nested object or an element within an array, React won't rerender the component as expected, leading to unexpected behavior.
